      <h2>1. Annual Figures Dashboard — Age UK Stockport</h2>
      <p><strong>Role:</strong> Data analysis & dashboard developer.</p>
      <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Manual static reports were not supporting dynamic decision making.</p>
      <p><strong>Solution & Outcome:</strong> Built an interactive dashboard (Excel / Power BI prototype) showing live KPIs which improved forecasting and donor reporting. Resulted in faster decisions and clearer board reporting. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}</p>

      <h2>2. 3D Campus Safety Walkthrough — University of Manchester</h2>
      <p><strong>Role:</strong> Project lead (team coordination, footage editing).</p>
      <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Students needed a clear visual guide for fire exits and safety routes.</p>
      <p><strong>Solution & Outcome:</strong> Delivered a 3D virtual walkthrough in two weeks; used for on-boarding and safety briefings. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}</p>

      <h2>3. Problem-Solving Page (this website) — Design concept</h2>
      <p><strong>Role:</strong> Lead designer & developer.</p>
      <p><strong>Problem:</strong> A local restaurant needs an online presence to improve bookings, customer engagement and modern communications.</p>
      <p><strong>Design concept & structure:</strong> I made the Problem-Solving page to be modular: clear business context, contact details, social integration, and an interactive form that generates a prefilled email sending booking/feedback details to the restaurant. This structure keeps the site lightweight (no server required), is accessible (mailto fallback), and can be extended to integrate with booking APIs later. The page demonstrates hand-coded HTML/CSS/JS skills and immediate business value (streamlining enquiries & bookings without a database).</p>
      <p><em>Why this matters:</em> Many small businesses need fast wins — an email generator/form plus clear social links increases conversions quickly while avoiding heavy backend development.</p>

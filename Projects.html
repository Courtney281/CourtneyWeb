                    This project involved creating an interactive data dashboard to explore key business performance metrics. The goal was to transform raw data into a clear, visual narrative that could support decision-making in a business environment. I focused on structuring datasets, identifying meaningful trends, and designing visual outputs that were both accessible and insightful.
